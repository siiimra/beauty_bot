        <p>I started using makeup when I was really young — blending, experimenting, and learning what worked for me. By the age of <strong>14</strong>, I had already become a <strong>certified makeup artist</strong>.</p>
        <p>In fact, I inspired my mom to become a makeup artist too! Even though she was just starting out, she often came to me for advice on what products to use and how to build her kit. That's when I realized both adults and younger individuals can feel overwhelmed by makeup.</p>
