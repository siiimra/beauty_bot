        <p>I started using makeup when I was really young — blending, experimenting, and learning what worked for me. By the age of <strong>14</strong>, I had already become a <strong>certified makeup artist</strong>.</p>
        <p>In fact, I inspired my mom to become a makeup artist too! Even though she was just starting out, she often came to me for advice on what products to use and how to build her kit. That's when I realized both adults and younger individuals can feel overwhelmed by makeup.</p>

    <p>There are hundreds of makeup products out there. But knowing <em>which ones actually suit you</em>, your skin type, your style, and your needs is the hard part.</p>
    <p>I created <strong>BeautyBot</strong> to make makeup feel less intimidating and more intuitive. Whether you’re a total beginner or just want better recommendations, BeautyBot helps you figure out what to use, and why.</p>
